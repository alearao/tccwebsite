These hands-on experiences, along with helping foster my ability to efficiently communicate and balance the needs of varying stakeholders, helped me become more proficient in crafting catered solutions through analysis of the unique problems of organizations in varying industries and stages. Ultimately, TCC provided me a unique opportunity to develop the necessary hard and soft skills to excel in real-life consulting, which was made possible by working with clients across a wide variety of industries, functions, and regions."
